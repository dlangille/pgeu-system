<h1>Pay with bank transfer</h1>
<p>
To pay your invoice using bank transfer, please make a payment
according to the following:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
  <th>Account information</th>
  <td>{{bankinfo|linebreaksbr}}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Payment reference</th>
 <td><strong>{{invoice.payment_reference}}</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Amount</th>
 <td>â‚¬{{invoice.total_amount}}</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that it is <b><i>very</i></b> important that you provide the
correct text on the transfer, or we may not be able to match your payment
to the correct invoice. In particular, <b>do not</b> use the invoice number,
use the specified payment reference!
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that bank transfers take a few days to process, so if your
payment is needed rapidly in order to confirm something, this is <strong>not</strong> a good
choice of payment method.
